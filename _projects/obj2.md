description: 'Collection of over 1000 photographs of Polish Armed Forces in the West,
  including organized military formations, established in the autumn of 1939 outside
  of Poland, on the basis of inter-allied agreements signed with France and the United
  Kingdom. The Polish Armed Forces were commanded by the Commander-in-Chief General
  Władysław Sikorski and later on General Kazimierz Sosnkowski. This collection includes
  three major groups of photographs associated with three military formations: Polish
  Armed Forces in the United Kingdom (1940-1944), the formation of Anders’ Army in
  the East, and the life of soldiers of the Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade
  in Africa (1940-1942).'
