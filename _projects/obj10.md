description: 'This collection includes the Annual Reports for St. Luke''s Hospital
  (1859-1976) and the Roosevelt Hospital (1871-1978).  These two famous New York City
  medical institutions were both founded in the 19th century to serve the worthy poor
  in the City.  Both grew to include education in their missions, training both young
  doctors in their residency programs, as well as nurses in three year diploma programs.
  Many scientific and clinical innovations occurred at these institutions, but their
  primary mission was and remains service. The Annual Reports detail the stories of
  the hospitals: their needs, their supporters, the people they served, and how they
  interacted with their communities in New York City. The Reports also show the advance
  of medicine, including information about how the hospitals responded to various
  epidemics and public health crises, from 19th century cholera to 20th century drug
  addiction. '
