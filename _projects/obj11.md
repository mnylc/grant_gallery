description: 'A unique colleciton of reports from the Institute of Public Administration
  on the origins of reform government in the US. The organization was created and
  financed in the early twentieth centurey by wealthy reform-minded New Yorkers, including
  the Rockefeller, Carnegie and Harriman families, to promote honest, efficient government.
  The IPA (and its predecessor, the Bureau of Municipal Research) taught NY and municipalities
  worldwide the necessities of budgets, training for public servants, and investigative
  studies to expose waste and corruption. Reports are from the period 1920-1950 and
  cover the workings of municipalities and states around the country and the measures
  taken by municipal governments to improve their operations. '
