description: Carnegie Hall booking ledgers that recorded every event that took place
  in the Hallâ€™s three auditoriums and were used to schedule performances spanning
  1955-2007. These ledgers include rare documentation of the great artists and managers
  of various music genres that have performed at the Hall over the past half-century,
  and also chronicle the wide range of non-musical events such as lectures, meetings,
  and civic rallies that have taken place.
