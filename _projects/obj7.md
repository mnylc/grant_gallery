description: This digital collection includes five seventeenth-century Mexican imprints
  that are among the earliest known primary sources in the lost Timucua language of
  Spanish Florida and among the first works ever published in a native language of
  the Americas. They owe their survival to antiquarian and linguist Buckingham Smith
  (1810-1871), whose collection of manuscripts and books related to Native American
  cultures and languages was donated to the New-York Historical Society in the 1880s.
