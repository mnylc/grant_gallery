collection_name: Political and religious pamphlets of the Italian unification, 1815-1871
collection_link: https://cdm17265.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/italianPamp
description: This collection of approximately 1600 short printed pamphlets was published
  in Italy, largely from 1815-1880, and markings on several of the items appear to
  link the collection with Cardinal Carlo Luigi Morichini (1805-1879) as a former
  owner. The pamphlets reflect the Catholic Church's outlook on and response to the
  sweeping changes occurring in 19th-century Italy, a period which witnessed the national
  unification of the Italian peninsula and the corresponding secularization of civil,
  political, and educational institutions.
